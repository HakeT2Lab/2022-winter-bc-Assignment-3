                Other than coding, I've found some intersets in the building or upgrading of computers.

                On the computer is where I spend most of my days,
                <br>
                Reading, playing games, having a great time,
                <br>
                Writing some code in my free time,
                <br>
                Than found a couple of bugs, that where up no good.
                <br>
                Causing errors in the vim.
